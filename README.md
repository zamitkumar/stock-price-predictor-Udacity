Title **Stock Price Prediction Capstone Project for Datascience Nanodegree(Udacity) **

**Description: **
This Capstone Project is focused on developing a Stock Price Predictor using machine learning techniques. The main goal is to predict stock prices, specifically the Close price, based on historical trading data, ultimately helping investors make more informed decisions.

Project Overview
The objective is to create a tool that accurately predicts stock prices by analyzing past trading data. The model will use key financial metrics such as:
* Opening prices: The price at which a stock starts trading for the day.
* Highest trading prices: The peak price reached during the trading session.
* Trading volume: The total number of shares traded during the session.
* Historical closing prices: The price at which the stock closed at the end of the trading day.
Problem Statement
One common challenge in stock trading is predicting stock movements, especially the Close price. Reliable predictions help investors make smarter decisions and reduce risk.
Objectives
1. Develop Predictive Models: Build machine learning models that can predict stock prices based on historical data.
2. Analyze Stock Correlations: Study relationships between different stocks to help in diversifying investment portfolios.
Data Description
The project relies on historical stock market data, which includes the following features:
* Open: The stock’s opening price.
* High: The highest price reached during the trading day.
* Low: The lowest price during the trading session.
* Close: The price at which the stock closes at the end of the day.
* Volume: The total shares traded during the day.
Data Source
The data will be fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library. It will include the necessary stock metrics such as the opening, closing, high, and low prices, along with trading volume.
Metrics for Evaluation
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures how far the model’s predictions are from the actual values.
* MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Quantifies prediction error as a percentage of the actual values.
* R² (R-squared): Evaluates how well the model explains the variance in stock prices.
* Correlation Coefficients: Helps understand how different stocks are related for diversification purposes.
Proposed Solution
1. Data Collection: Gather historical stock data via APIs such as yfinance.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize the data, handling missing values, and generating additional features like moving averages (e.g., 5-day, 20-day) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMA).
3. Model Selection:
    * Linear Regression: A baseline model for stock price prediction.
    * Random Forests: A model that captures non-linear relationships and is more powerful for complex datasets.
4. Model Evaluation: Split the data into training, validation, and test sets, and evaluate the models using various performance metrics.
Expected Outcomes
* A predictive model to forecast stock prices (specifically the Close price).
* An interactive interface for users to access and visualize stock predictions easily.
* Insights into market trends that can guide investment decisions.
Future Directions
The project could evolve further with:
* Real-time data integration for live stock price predictions.
* Reinforcement learning to build dynamic trading strategies.
* API development to integrate with other financial tools.
* Stock split integration and news sentiment analysis to improve predictions.
* The ability to handle multiple stocks simultaneously for broader market analysis.
Setup and Tools
* Programming Language: Python is used for its versatility and rich ecosystem of libraries.
* Core Libraries:
    * NumPy and SciPy for numerical and scientific computations.
    * Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
    * yfinance to fetch historical stock data.
Data Collection & Preprocessing
Using yfinance, you can easily fetch stock data for companies like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN). Data preprocessing involves:
* Handling missing values (e.g., through interpolation).
* Normalizing data to ensure consistency across features.
* Adding additional features like moving averages to provide more context for predictions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA step includes:
* Plotting historical closing prices for stock trends.
* Analyzing daily trading volume to understand market activity.
* Creating Moving Averages (10, 20, 50 days) to capture short-term trends.
* Calculating volatility using rolling standard deviations over 10-day windows.
Model Selection and Evaluation
* Random Forest Regressor will be the starting model due to its ability to handle complex datasets and capture non-linear relationships. It will be fine-tuned through grid search to find the best hyperparameters.
* Performance will be evaluated using:
    * RMSE to measure prediction accuracy.
    * MAPE to assess the percentage error in predictions.
Portfolio Diversification
The project will also look at stock correlations to suggest diversified portfolios. If stocks have a high positive correlation (e.g., AAPL and MSFT), they may not offer much diversification. However, if stocks like AAPL and TSLA are less correlated, adding TSLA could help balance the portfolio.
Query Interface
Users can input:
* A list of stock tickers.
* A list of query dates. The system will then output predicted stock prices for those tickers on the specified dates.
Performance Metrics
* MAPE: Measures the average percentage error.
* RMSE: Measures the average magnitude of the prediction error.
Future Enhancements
The project could be expanded with:
For more accurate predictions, you may consider using more advanced machine learning techniques or time series forecasting models like LSTM, or XGBoost.
Integrate real-time data for live prediction capabilities.
Investigate reinforcement learning for adaptive trading strategies.
Develop APIs for seamless integration with other financial platforms.
Factor in stock splits when making predictions.
Trade Recommendations: Provide buy, sell, or hold suggestions based on forecasted price trends.
Portfolio Simulation: Enable users to evaluate strategies by testing them against historical data.
Financial News Sentiment Analysis: Incorporate sentiment from financial news to improve predictions.
Multi-stock Analysis: Expand the model to analyze and predict for multiple stocks at once.
