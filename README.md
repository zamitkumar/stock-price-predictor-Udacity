This Capstone Project is focused on building a Stock Price Predictor using machine learning techniques, particularly aimed at predicting stock prices based on historical data and improving investment decisions. Here's a breakdown and analysis of the key aspects of the project:

****Project Overview****
The goal is to create a tool that can predict stock prices, specifically the Close price, using historical trading data. The model leverages financial metrics like:

Opening prices
Highest trading prices
Trading volume
Historical closing prices
Problem Statement
The project is addressing a common issue in stock trading: the ability to reliably predict stock movements, especially the Close price. This prediction can significantly help investors make more informed decisions.

**Objectives**
Develop Predictive Models: Create machine learning models to predict stock prices using past data.
Analyze Stock Correlations: Identify correlations between different stocks and help in diversifying investment portfolios.
Data Description
The project uses historical stock market data, which includes:

Date
Open: Stock's opening price.
High: Highest price of the stock for the day.
Low: Lowest price of the stock for the day.
Close: Final price of the stock at the end of the session.
Volume: Total shares traded.
Data Source
Data will be fetched from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance Python library. The dataset will include the stock's opening, closing, high, low prices, and trading volume.

**Metrics**
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): To assess prediction accuracy.
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): To express prediction error as a percentage.
R² (R-squared): To check how well the model explains the variance in stock prices.
Correlation Coefficients: To understand the relationship between different stocks for portfolio diversification.
Proposed Solution
Data Collection: Fetch historical data via APIs like yfinance.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and generating new features like moving averages (5-day, 20-day) and EMA (Exponential Moving Averages).
**Model Selection:**
Linear Regression: For a baseline model.
Random Forests: To capture non-linear relationships.

Model Evaluation: Split data into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the models using various performance metrics.
Expected Outcomes
A robust predictive model to forecast stock prices (Close price).
An interactive interface for users to easily access stock predictions.
Insights into market trends to guide investment decisions.
Future Directions
The project could evolve into a more dynamic tool:

Real-time data for live predictions.
Reinforcement learning for creating dynamic trading strategies.
API development to integrate with other financial tools.
Stock Split Integration and News Sentiment Analysis.
Extend to handle multiple stocks simultaneously for broader market analysis.
Setup and Tools
Python is the main programming language.
Libraries:
NumPy, SciPy for numerical and scientific computations.
Pandas for data manipulation.
yfinance for fetching stock data.
Data Collection & Preprocessing
You are using yfinance to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance for companies like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), etc. The preprocessing steps involve:

Handling missing data (e.g., using interpolation).
Normalizing the data to ensure consistency across features.
Generating additional features like moving averages to enrich the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Plotting the stock’s historical closing prices.
Analyzing daily trading volume.
Creating Moving Averages (10, 20, 50 days) to visualize trends.
Calculating volatility using rolling standard deviations over a 10-day window.
Model Selection and Evaluation
Random Forest Regressor: Used as the initial model to predict stock prices. You plan to fine-tune it using grid search to optimize hyperparameters.
The performance of the model will be evaluated using:
RMSE: Measures how far predictions are from the actual values.
MAPE: Quantifies the prediction error as a percentage.
Portfolio Diversification
The project involves evaluating the correlation between different stocks to recommend diversified portfolios. A high positive correlation indicates that stocks move together, while a low or negative correlation suggests that they can be combined for diversification benefits. For example:

AAPL and MSFT: Strongly correlated, adding both may not add diversification.
AAPL and TSLA: Less correlated, adding TSLA could improve portfolio diversification.
Query Interface
Users can input:

A list of stock tickers.
A list of query dates. And the system will output predicted stock prices for those tickers on those dates.
Performance Metrics
To evaluate the model:

MAPE: Measures the average percentage error.
RMSE: Measures the average magnitude of the error.
Future Enhancements
The project could further improve by:

Developing a web interface using Flask for user interactions.
Integrating external factors like stock splits, macroeconomics, and news sentiment for more accurate predictions.
Conclusion
This is a comprehensive stock price prediction project that combines data analysis, machine learning, and financial metrics. It not only aims to predict stock prices but also provides portfolio diversification insights. The project can be expanded with real-time data, reinforcement learning, and further analytical features to help investors make better decisions.
